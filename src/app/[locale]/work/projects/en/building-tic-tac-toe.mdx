## Overview

This project was all about recreating the timeless Tic Tac Toe game as a fun way to learn React. The goal was to build a dynamic and responsive interface with interactive features that made the game enjoyable for players.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players can easily click to make their moves, and the game shows the winner or if it’s a draw.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Game state updates in real-time as players take turns.
- **Reset Option**: A button to restart the game anytime for a new round.
- **Responsive Design**: The game layout adjusts seamlessly for both desktop and mobile screens.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: To manage the component structure and handle state.
- **CSS**: For styling the game and making it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: To implement game logic.
- **CodeSandbox**: For experimenting and building the project online.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the trickiest parts was managing the game’s state correctly—keeping track of whose turn it was, updating the board, and determining the winner. It taught me a lot about how React handles state and re-renders components.  

Designing for smaller screens was another interesting challenge, as I had to think about how to make the grid and controls user-friendly on mobile devices.

## Outcome

The project turned out to be a fantastic learning experience, not only for React but also for creating an engaging user interface. It’s a fun game that anyone can play, and I’m proud of how smooth and responsive it feels.
