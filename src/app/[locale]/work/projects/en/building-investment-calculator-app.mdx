## Overview

The Investment Calculator app lets users input investment details and see a breakdown of how their money could grow over time. Itâ€™s a simple yet practical tool for learning and exploring investment projections.

## Key Features

- **Customizable Inputs**: Users can input the initial amount, annual interest rate, duration, and yearly contributions.
- **Dynamic Results**: The app calculates and displays results instantly as inputs change.
- **Clear Visualization**: Investment growth is shown in a clean and easy-to-read format.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: For building components and managing application state.
- **CSS**: To style the interface and make it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: To handle investment calculation logic.
- **CodeSandbox**: For quick prototyping and sharing.

## Challenges and Learnings

Understanding how to efficiently calculate compound interest and dynamically update the UI was a great challenge. I also learned how to organize and structure forms in React to handle user input cleanly.  

Testing and refining the layout to make sure it worked across different screen sizes taught me the importance of responsive design principles.

## Outcome

This project taught me a lot about React and how to connect functionality with clean design. The calculator is easy to use, and it makes complex investment calculations accessible to everyone.
