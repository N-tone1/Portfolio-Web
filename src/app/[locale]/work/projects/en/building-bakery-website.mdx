## Overview

I built a website for Pekara Martin to show their products, share contact details, and make it easier for customers to find the bakery.

## Key Features

- **Product Gallery**: A section with pictures and descriptions of bakery products so customers can see what’s available.
- **Interactive Map**: I added a map using Leaflet to help people easily locate the bakery.
- **Mobile-Friendly Design**: I made sure the website looks good and works well on phones and tablets.
- **Contact Form**: I created a form so customers can reach out directly from the website.
- **Local Focus**: I kept everything simple and clear for Croatian users.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**: For building and styling the website.
- **Leaflet.js**: To add the interactive map.
- **Responsive Design**: I used CSS to make the site adjust to different screen sizes.
- **Visual Studio Code**: For writing and testing the code.
- **GitHub**: To keep track of changes and save my work.

## Challenges and Learnings

I had to figure out how to make the site look good on both big and small screens, which meant learning more about responsive design. Adding the map with Leaflet was also new, but it turned out to be a great way to help customers find the bakery.  

It was also important to keep the site easy to use, especially since it’s for a local audience.

## Outcome

The website works well on all devices and makes it easier for customers to explore Pekara Martin’s products, find the location, and get in touch. This project taught me a lot about web development and how to create something simple but useful.
