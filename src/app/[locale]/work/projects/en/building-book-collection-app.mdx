## Overview

Development of a user-friendly app to track and manage books you've read, using Express.js for the back-end and EJS for front-end rendering.

## Key Features

- **Book Management**: Implemented a system to add, edit, and delete books with details such as title, author, genre, and reading status (e.g., "Read" or "To-Read").
- **Responsive Design**: Designed an interface that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring usability across devices.
- **Database Integration**: Used PostgreSQL to store and retrieve book data securely, enabling users to maintain a persistent record of their reading history.
- **User Feedback**: Included a feature to rate books and add personal notes, making the app a comprehensive reading tracker.
- **Dynamic Views**: Utilized EJS to render dynamic and interactive book lists and detail pages.

## Technologies Used

- **Express.js**: For back-end development and handling server-side logic.
- **EJS**: For rendering dynamic front-end templates.
- **PostgreSQL**: For persistent storage of book data.
- **CSS**: For responsive and visually appealing design.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the primary challenges was ensuring the app remained intuitive while supporting a growing list of features. To tackle this, we focused on simplifying the user interface and prioritizing core functionalities. Additionally, integrating PostgreSQL with Express.js taught valuable lessons about managing database connections efficiently and securely. 

Another learning experience was mastering EJS for creating dynamic, reusable views, which streamlined the development process and reduced repetitive code.

## Outcome

The book tracking app has become a valuable tool for organizing and reflecting on reading habits. It provides a cohesive user experience and encourages users to track their progress and discover new books. The project also served as a practical exercise in full-stack development, demonstrating how to integrate various technologies into a functional and user-friendly product.
