## Overview

The Joke Generator app provides users with a random joke at the click of a button. Built using **Express.js** and **EJS**, the app delivers humor in a simple yet effective interface, perfect for anyone in need of a quick laugh.

## Key Features

- **Random Joke Generation**: Users can click a button to receive a random joke from a collection of pre-written jokes.
- **Easy-to-Use Interface**: The minimalist design ensures that users can quickly and effortlessly enjoy a joke without distraction.
- **Backend Logic**: The app uses **Express.js** to manage API requests and serve random jokes dynamically.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is mobile-friendly, ensuring accessibility and usability on all devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Express.js**: Handles routes and API logic for serving random jokes to the user.
- **Node.js**: Used for backend development, processing requests and handling server-side logic.
- **EJS**: Renders the dynamic views and injects the jokes into the front-end template.
- **CSS**: Styles the app to provide a responsive and visually appealing experience across devices.

## Challenges and Learnings

A major challenge was ensuring the jokes were appropriate, diverse, and fun. I used an API to pull jokes, but I also had to ensure the responses were quick and efficient, especially when the app grew in popularity.

Learning to work with **Express.js** for backend routing and **EJS** for dynamic templates helped improve my understanding of building interactive web applications. Handling asynchronous data in the backend while maintaining a smooth user experience was a valuable takeaway.

## Outcome

The Joke Generator has become a fun tool for quick entertainment, and itâ€™s a great example of how **Express.js** and **EJS** can be used to create an interactive web app. This project improved my skills in backend logic, API handling, and template rendering, reinforcing my understanding of full-stack development.
